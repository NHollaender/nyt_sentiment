The suit was brought on behalf of two longtime club members, Logan Van Sittert and Barbara Van Sittert, who asked its board members in 2006 to allow women in the men\u2019s grill. According to the complaint, Mr. and Mrs. Van Sittert were subjected to verbal abuse and threats after their inquiry, including graffiti on the golf course that referred to Mrs. Van Sittert in vulgar terms. The attorney general is seeking compensatory damages for the Van Sitterts and a permanent injunction prohibiting the club from sex-based discrimination.
