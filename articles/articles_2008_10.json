More than one million signatures are necessary to force a recall election, something the union says would have cost upwards of $3 million. Nichol Gomez-Pryde, a union spokeswoman, said the union would instead concentrate on defeating state ballot measures that involve redistricting and reducing prison terms for drug offenders. A spokeswoman for the governor, Julie Soderlund, said the threat of recall had been \u201ctotally unproductive\u201d and an effort by the union to get more money out of the state, something the union denied.

The state\u2019s Pilot Commission approved a report that said Capt. John Cota committed several errors, including leaving port in thick fog on the morning of Nov. 7 and sailing the ship too fast. The ship, the Cosco Busan, crashed into a support tower of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and leaked more than 50,000 gallons of oil. The spill killed thousands of birds and fouled 26 miles of shoreline. Despite the findings, the commission has no authority over Captain Cota because he has already surrendered his pilot license and retired.
