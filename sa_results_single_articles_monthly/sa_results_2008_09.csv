And then Dr. Jim Taylor, a delegate from the convention from Pinehurst, N.C., came over to the fence and began chatting with Mr. Westgate in between his yelps on behalf of Mr. Paul. “The work you are doing is great and I want you to know that people in the convention are doing lots of talking about Mr. Paul.

The lawsuit against the Phoenix Country Club cited the club’s policy of allowing only men in its well-appointed grill room as violating the state’s civil rights act.,"The State Attorney General’s Office has filed a lawsuit against the Phoenix Country Club, citing the club’s policy of allowing only men in its well-appointed grill room as violating the state’s civil rights act. According to the complaint, the club’s policy of offering men one place to dine, a room with fine amenities conducive to business meetings, and women another, essentially a card room with a hotplate, is discriminatory. The suit was brought on behalf of two longtime club members, Logan Van Sittert and Barbara Van Sittert, who asked its board members in 2006 to allow women in the men’s grill. According to the complaint, Mr. and Mrs. Van Sittert were subjected to verbal abuse and threats after their inquiry, including graffiti on the golf course that referred to Mrs. Van Sittert in vulgar terms. The attorney general is seeking compensatory damages for the Van Sitterts and a permanent injunction prohibiting the club from sex-based discrimination.
