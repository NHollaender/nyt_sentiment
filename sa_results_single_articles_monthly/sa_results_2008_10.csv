Nichol Gomez-Pryde, a union spokeswoman, said the union would instead concentrate on defeating state ballot measures that involve redistricting and reducing prison terms for drug offenders. A spokeswoman for the governor, Julie Soderlund, said the threat of recall had been “totally unproductive” and an effort by the union to get more money out of the state, something the union denied.
