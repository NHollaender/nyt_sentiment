In order for them to help you, they must know you. And you must know what will motivate them. Nurture them so they can help you lead. They must believe in not just your ideas, but you.14.Good will matters.15.Women are particularly good at listening and studying their audience.16.Have the courage to make tough decisions.17.When you lead, not everyone will follow, and that’s okay.18.You will fail. Don’t take your failures or your success too seriously. Learn to laugh at yourself. Trust me. It helps.19.Affiliate yourself with worthy institutions, lead by good people who share your core values.20.You can have it all, just not at the same time, and in the proportions you may want.21.To those who much is given, much is expected.","{'main': 'Jarrett’s Life Lessons', 'kicker': 'The Caucus', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': None, 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",Jarrett’s Life Lessons,0.5,0.5,0.16331196581196583,0.5515384615384615,0.0,0.0,2008,11
