The state’s public defender system is facing a lawsuit that seeks to halt prosecutions in hundreds of northeast Georgia cases until lawyers are provided to represent the defendants.,"The state’s struggling public defender system is facing a lawsuit that seeks to halt prosecutions in hundreds of northeast Georgia cases until lawyers are provided to represent the defendants. It is one of the stiffest legal challenges yet to the system, which has lost support from powerful state legislators and faces mounting financial problems amid the economic downturn.

Some have been without lawyers for six months, said the suit, which was filed by the Southern Center for Human Rights, which is based in Atlanta.
